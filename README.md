## Graceful Degradation and Service Workers
1. How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
    Graceful degradation and service workers are related because they both try to make applications functional in the less ideal situations. Graceful dregradation is more building applications with functionality with fallacks for older browsers. Service workers on the otherhand enable applications wot work offline by caching resources. Both can be used to improve user experience.
